\section*{Why Machine Learning Matters?}

Machine learning is able to handle huge volumes of data, accelerating end-user access to the insights. With cognitive computing, the business can also see improved productivity and streamlined operations. IT teams, too, enjoy seeing some of the more mundane tasks automated so that resources can be directed instead to technology innovation and business growth.

While the two research studies cited thus far both hover around 12 billion predictions, only Tractica comes in lower — predicting \$11.1 billion machine learning market revenue by 2024. Otherwise, Allied Market Research expects machine learning to generate revenue of 13.7\% billion by 2020. International Data Corporation forecasts the cognitive systems market will soar to more than \$31 billion in 2019.
IBM is even more bullish. The company behind the popularly known Watson (Jeopardy champion and currently on TV chatting with the likes of Stephen King), forecasts a \$2 trillion opportunity in the machine learning market over the next decade. IBM chief executive Ginni Rometty reportedly observed, “It’s not stealing from anything, but creating new value.”
