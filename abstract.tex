\begin{abstract}
Machine learning is a core sub-area of AI as it enables a computer system to get into a mode of self learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, computer programs, are enabled to learn, grow, change and develop by themselves. That is one of the core concepts of Artificial Intelligence, a system which could develop by itself, much like us, humans.

We can obviously use machine learning algorithms to solve various problems in our daily life. For example, there can be music generation, or maybe making a car drive itself. There are ideas where the seat of the car would measure fatigue of the driver of the car and then make it stop if it feels(detects) that the driver is too tired to drive a car.
